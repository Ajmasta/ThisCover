ThisCover is an app that tries to emulate the feeling of browsing through books at the library or at a bookstore.
Choose a genre and then simply swipe on books covers left or right, to either discard or save them.
They are stored in your phone storage so you can go back to them later.
You can also click on the books to get more details.

It was built using react-native, expo and react-native-reanimated 2.

## Running the app

If you want to build the app and run it, you might need an API key. Check the section below to know how to get one.
Mock data is available if you don't use the API key.

After getting the API key you will also need to create a .env file with

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Api Issues

I built this app with a temporary API that has a very low rate (20 requests/hour) because it was the best free one I could find for my purposes.
If you want to try out the app as it was meant to be you can get an API key [here](https://rapidapi.com/roftcomp-laGmBwlWLm/api/hapi-books/)

Otherwise, I have also added some mock data so that you can see the layout of every screen even when the API fails.

## Future updates

In the future, I plan to integrate Google login and Google Books API.
I also plan to improve the saved list management.
